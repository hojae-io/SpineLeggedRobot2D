# SpineLeggedRobot2D
This repository is an open-source code for the course project of the MIT 2.74 Bio-inspired Robotics class.

#### Title: Galloping with Spine <br/>  
Here, we implemented a 2D legged robot (2 legs) with a spinal joint and investigated the benefit of the spinal joint.
The code stack includes the derivation of the dynamics equation of motion, implementation of the simulator, and convex model predictive controller(MPC).
